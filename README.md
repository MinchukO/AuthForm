# Create React App Auth Form

- [DEMO LINK HERE](https://minchuko.github.io/AuthForm/)

## Description
Validation schema:

Email is required and has to be matched with email validation rules;
Password is required;
Remember me checkbox is boolean value.
The validation errors have to be displayed after submit button is pressed and then a focused field has to be revalidated on every input change.

"Sign up", Google and Microsoft providers, "Forgot Password?" are custom buttons. No need to handle any of their actions but keep designed styles.

 - React (custom hooks)
 - Sass (I used @mixin and variables for example)
 - classnames
